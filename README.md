# probabilisticTeaching

This program generates results for Lesson 10, Course 3  of the game Artist on code.org based on potential decisions that a student might make while playing the game. The goal of the program is to produce the probability of what a given student might or might not know based on the decisions they make. 

By generating large enough probabilistic results, it aims to show the underlying factors in a student's success or failure in the process of learning in a given game, in this case, learning for loops in the context of drawing nested shapes. Such probabilistic approach might inform us, as educators, to improve our understanding of the unseen or often overlooked factors that influence learning process. If such probabilistic investigation proves successful in making predictions about what effects learning, it can inform the design process of learning resources and thus, contribute to teaching and learning. This small attempt to examine a single game in the Artist game can then be scaled to other games and platforms of teaching.
